# ContactsDex
This project was created in BlueJ and they have their own graphical user interface for input and that is what I used
V1.0
- everything is done throught he rolodex class
- contacts can be added, searched for, and connections can be made between them
- the connections are in a graph stored as an adjacency list
- additionally recent contacts are stored in a stack
- theres definitely room to improve readability by dividing up methods into sub methods
- the input verification also need some work
- I think the lists in the graph may be able to be sotred in a hash map as well for increased efficiency
